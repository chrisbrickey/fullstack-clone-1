# insta-Ã©toile

#####
This visual platform enables performing artists (ballet dancers to start) to share and showcase photos and videos of their craft while building a community of supporters and followers. The longer-term vision is to further the careers of performing artists by providing robust user profiles that are much more immersive than sites like LinkedIn.

### Future Development:

##### Video Play
Performing artists will be able to upload and share videos of rehearsals and performances.

##### Robust User Profiles
Performing artists will be able to synthesize and showcase their experience and talent in a full page profile.  They can share their career journey with pictures and videos accompanied by supporting text.  

##### Explore & Follow
Casting staff and the broader community will be able to search and follow performing artists.  A user's photo feed will consists only of posts from artists that they are following.  Users will be able to search for performing artists based on content of their posts and profiles.
