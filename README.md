## Future Development:

##### Video Play
Performing artists will be able to upload and share videos of rehearsals and performances.

##### Robust User Profiles
Performing artists will be able to synthesize and showcase their experience and talent in a full page profile.  They can share their career journey with pictures and videos accompanied by supporting text. The user profile template will allow for some curation but will maintain a consistent structure that is easy for others to absorb.

##### Explore & Follow
Casting staff and the broader community will be able to search and follow performing artists.  A user's photo feed will consists only of posts from artists that they are following.  Users will be able to search for performing artists based on content of their posts and profiles.
